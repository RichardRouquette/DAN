We evaluated the proposed method on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling contest (Potsdam), which is an open benchmark dataset. This dataset contains 38 very high-resolution true 
orthophoto (TOP) tiles extracted from a large TOP mosaic. ISPRS only provides 24 labeled images for training, while the remaining 14 tiles are unreleased. In this study, 
we randomly used five of the labeled images(mainly contains top_potsdam_3_11,top_potsdam_4_11,top_potsdam_7_7,top_potsdam_7_11 and top_potsdam_7_12) as the validation set 
and the remaining labeled images as the training models.
